NMAP StreamLined is a script Side-Project I am developing in order to practice bash scripting. nmapSL prompts the user for a hostname, enumerates all open ports using nmap, then feeds that output into a second nmap scan that runs a service check and OS fingerprinting against the host. In the future I plan to add varying levels of scan intensity, and allowing the user to select their own options
